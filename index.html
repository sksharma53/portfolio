    <h2>Capstone Project</h2>
    <p>The central objective of this capstone project is to enhance the efficiency and productivity at Acxiom by implementing a comprehensive system to track the weekly working hours of employees. This initiative aims to analyze employee schedules, identify patterns, and optimize the overall workflow. To accomplish this goal, a systematic system analysis and design approach will be employed to ensure a thorough understanding of the existing processes and to devise an effective plan for implementation.</p>

    <h3>Requirements:</h3>
    <p>The requirements for the new system include integrating with existing time-tracking tools, collecting and analyzing employee working hour data, identifying areas for efficiency improvement, and implementing a monitoring system to track progress. While recognizing potential risks such as inaccuracies in data analysis and the need for careful balancing to avoid negative impacts on the employee experience, the benefits of optimizing employee work patterns are deemed valuable.</p>

    <h3>Analysis:</h3>
    <p><strong>Current System:</strong><br>
        The current system relies on manual tracking methods, lacking a centralized and automated approach. Employees submit their working hours through various channels, making it challenging to compile accurate data efficiently.</p>

    <p><strong>Requirements:</strong><br>
        The new system will integrate with existing time-tracking tools, ensuring accurate and real-time data collection. It will identify areas for improvement by analyzing working hour patterns and propose adaptive strategies for enhanced efficiency.</p>

    <h3>Stakeholders:</h3>
    <p>Stakeholders for this project encompass employees, managers, and human resources personnel. The system aims to benefit employees by providing a more transparent and accurate representation of their working hours, aiding managers in optimizing team schedules, and supporting HR in ensuring compliance.</p>

    <h3>Design:</h3>
    <p><strong>System Architecture:</strong><br>
        The new system will be designed to integrate seamlessly with existing time-tracking tools, ensuring a smooth transition. It will focus on automating data collection and analysis, reducing manual efforts, and improving accuracy.</p>

    <p><strong>User Interface Design:</strong><br>
        The user interface will prioritize user experience, providing an intuitive platform for employees to access their working hour details easily. Clear navigation and visual representations of working hour patterns will enhance user understanding.</p>

    <p><strong>Database Design:</strong><br>
        The database will be designed to store and analyze working hour data efficiently. Integration with existing tools will streamline data collection, and advanced analytics will identify patterns and trends.</p>

    <h3>Testing:</h3>
    <p>Comprehensive testing, including data analysis, user testing, and system integration testing, will be conducted to ensure the system meets requirements and functions reliably.</p>

    <h3>Implementation:</h3>
    <p>The new system will be implemented in phases, focusing on specific aspects such as data integration, automation, and user interface improvements. A well-defined timeline, budget, and resource allocation plan will guide the implementation process.</p>

    <h3>Maintenance:</h3>
    <p>Post-implementation, the system will be regularly monitored and maintained to ensure continuous improvement and alignment with organizational needs. Updates and improvements will be made as necessary to optimize its effectiveness.</p>

    <p>By employing a systematic approach, this project aims to enhance organizational insight into employee work patterns, contributing to improved efficiency and productivity at Acxiom. The integration of automated tracking, data analysis, and adaptive strategies will foster a work environment that aligns with the organization's goals.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity.
    Clarity is not the same as simplicity. Often, simple thing are clear 
    is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily 
    large amount of data.
    </p>

    <div id="alert" class="alert"><p>This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective opragnization
        and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bit-sized"
        chunks of data, as simplification does.
    </p></div>

    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time,
        rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often 
        responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.
    </p>

    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remeber to markup the information
        properly using HTML.</p>
    <h4>Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute.</h4>
    <p>The "alt" attribute in HTML, applied to the `<img>` element, serves the crucial role of providing alternative text for images. This text is essential for accessibility, aiding users with visual impairments by describing the image or its function. The "alt" attribute content is also displayed if the image fails to load. In contrast, the "title" attribute is a more general-purpose attribute used to provide supplementary information about HTML elements, such as links or images. This information is displayed as a tooltip when users hover over the element. Unlike "alt," the "title" attribute is not primarily focused on accessibility but offers additional context or details for users.</p>
    <h4>Please provide an example of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary below</h4>
    <p>To mark up a definition in HTML, you can use the  (definition list),  (definition term), and  (definition description) elements. The  element creates the overall list, while  is used for the term or word being defined, and  is used for the corresponding definition or description. </p>
    <h4>Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site</h4>

    <p><strong>Navigating the Intersection of Technology and Employment Law: A Case Study</strong></p>

    <p>In pursuit of my degree in information science, I have been investigating the complex intersection of employment law and technology. For my case study, I focused on a forward-thinking technology company with over 3800 employees and a strong reliance on technology. To protect the privacy of my participant, I'll simply identify them as the "Head of Technology."</p>

    <p>The company, based in Austin, Texas, operates under federal and state employment laws, including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), the Civil Rights Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). My interview with the Head of Technology provided insights into various HR-related topics, from hiring practices to employee development.</p>

    <p>The complexity of the FLSA, which regulates child labor, overtime, and minimum pay, is crucial to the organization's employment practices. The company's hiring methods have both positive and negative aspects, with a dedication to diversity but room for improvement in recruitment efforts and bias reduction.</p>

    <p>If I were to imagine myself as a future information science specialist managing employment issues, I would implement measures to promote diversity, ensure ethical hiring practices, and reduce litigation risks:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Inclusive Outreach:</strong> Establish partnerships with community organizations and schools to create a diverse talent pipeline, participating in mentorship programs, career fairs, and workshops.</li>

        <li><strong>Skill-Based Assessments:</strong> Implement role-specific skill assessments to reduce discriminatory questions and ensure a fair evaluation process.</li>

        <li><strong>Diversity Training:</strong> Develop an ongoing diversity training program for all employees, emphasizing diversity, equity, and inclusion, with a focus on unconscious bias awareness.</li>

        <li><strong>Robust Data Analytics:</strong> Leverage data analysis tools to monitor and evaluate hiring practices continually, providing real-time insights into diversity efforts.</li>

        <li><strong>Third-Party Audits:</strong> Engage third-party organizations to conduct independent audits of recruitment practices periodically.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Through this insightful interview and analysis, I have equipped myself to navigate the complex landscape of legal challenges, advancing my career and championing ethical and legally compliant recruitment practices in the technology industry.</p>

    <h3>Case Study 2: Madison v. Alabama</h3>

    <p><strong>Case Name:</strong> Madison v. Alabama, No. 17-7505 (2019)</p>

    <p><strong>Factual History:</strong> Vernon Madison was sentenced to the death penalty in Alabama after being found guilty of murder. Madison was suffering from serious dementia and memory loss over time as a result of strokes and other medical problems. The condition of his mind became so bad that he was unable to recall his involvement in the crime or understand the reasons behind his death.</p>

    <p><strong>Procedural History:</strong> The case of Vernon Madison had many appeals in both state and federal courts. The main question was whether the Eighth Amendment's restriction on cruel and unusual punishment applied to the execution of a person with severe dementia who had no memory of committing the crime.</p>

    <p><strong>Issues Presented:</strong> Does the Eighth Amendment forbid the death penalty for those who don't recall committing the crime?</p>

    <p><strong>Decision:</strong> Yes, the Eighth Amendment bans the execution of a criminal who has no memory of having committed the crime.</p>

    <p><strong>Rules of the Law:</strong> Cruel and unusual punishment is prohibited by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Due to their lowered guilt, the Supreme Court has ruled that some criminal types, such as those who are mentally disabled and adolescents, are ineligible for the death penalty.</p>

    <p><strong>Application of the Law:</strong> The Supreme Court determined that it would be a cruel and unusual punishment to execute a person with severe dementia who is unable to remember the crime they committed. Madison was categorically ineligible for the death penalty due to his significant cognitive decline because he could not understand the justifications for his execution, and it would have no retributive effect.</p>

    <p><strong>Disposition:</strong> The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that sentencing Vernon Madison to death would be against the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment due to his profound dementia and lack of memory of the offense. His death sentence was overturned by the court, and the case was sent back for more actions that complied with the ruling.</p>

    <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> In this case, I agree with the Supreme Court's decision. A person's mental capability and degree of guilt must be considered while applying the Eighth Amendment's restriction on cruel and unusual punishment. Executing someone who has severe dementia and is unable to understand the justification for their death or remember the crime they committed serves no purpose and would, in fact, be cruel and unusual. The values of justice and humanity are maintained by this decision in our legal system.</p>
